# Blockchain-Based Insurance Claims Processing System

This repository contains a set of smart contracts that implement a decentralized insurance claims processing system on blockchain technology.

## Overview

The system streamlines the insurance claims process through a series of specialized smart contracts that handle different stages of claims processing:

- **Policy Verification**: Validates active insurance coverage and policy details
- **Claim Submission**: Records incident details and damage information
- **Evidence Storage**: Securely manages supporting documentation for claims
- **Adjudication**: Tracks review and approval process
- **Settlement**: Manages payment disbursement to claimants

## Architecture

The system consists of five core smart contracts that work together to process insurance claims:

1. **PolicyVerification.sol**: Verifies the existence and validity of insurance policies
2. **ClaimSubmission.sol**: Handles the submission of new insurance claims
3. **EvidenceStorage.sol**: Manages documentation related to claims
4. **Adjudication.sol**: Facilitates the review and decision-making process
5. **Settlement.sol**: Executes payments when claims are approved

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum development environment (Truffle, Hardhat, or similar)
- Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or higher recommended)
- Web3.js or ethers.js for frontend integration
- MetaMask or similar wallet for testing

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-insurance-claims.git
   cd blockchain-insurance-claims
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

Deploy the contracts to your preferred network:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### Workflow

1. **Policy Registration**: Insurance providers register policies in the PolicyVerification contract
2. **Claim Filing**: Policyholders submit claims through the ClaimSubmission contract
3. **Evidence Upload**: Supporting documentation is stored via the EvidenceStorage contract
4. **Review Process**: Claims are reviewed through the Adjudication contract
5. **Payment**: Approved claims trigger automatic payments via the Settlement contract

## Security Considerations

- All contracts include access control mechanisms to restrict sensitive operations
- Data privacy is maintained through appropriate encryption and hashing techniques
- Regular security audits are recommended before production deployment
